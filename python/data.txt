With remote acquisitions, what problems should you be aware of?
Antivirus, antispyware, and firewall programs
Why is it a good practice to make two images of a suspect drive in a critical investigation?
To ensure at least one good copy of the forensically collected data in case of any failures
In Linux, the fdisk -l command lists the suspect drive as /dev/hda1. So, the following dcfldd is command correct. dcfldd if=image_file.img of=/dev/hda1

True
In the Linux dcfldd command, which three options are used for validating data?
hash, hashlog, and vf
What's the maximum file size when writing data to a FAT32 drive?

What are two concerns when acquiring data from a RAID server?

False
What does a sparse acquisition collect for an investigation?
Fragments of unallocated data in addition to the logical allocated data
The main goal of a static acquisition is the preservation of digital evidence.
True
Which forensics tools can connect to a suspect's remote computer and run surreptitiously?
EnCase Enterprise and ProDiscover Incident Response
What's the most critical aspect of digital evidence?
Validation
Name two commercial tools that can make a forensic sector-by-sector copy of a drive to a larger drive.
EnCase and X-Ways Forensics
